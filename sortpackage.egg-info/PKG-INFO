Description: #sortpackage
        This library has two separate modules within it; recursion.py and sorting.py.
        
        recursion.py contains functions that use recursion to solve basic problems.
        The following functions can be found within recursion.py:
          1) sum_array(array) - returns the sum of all elements in an array
          2) fibonacci(n) - calculates the nth term in a fibonacci sequence
          3) factorial(n) - calculates n factorial (n!)
          4) reverse(word) - returns a word in reverse order
        
        sorting.py contains functions that sort an array using distinct sorting algorithms.
        The following functions can be found within sorting.py:
          1) bubble_sort(items) - uses the bubble sort algorithm to return an array
             ordered in ascending order
          1) merge_sort(items) - uses the merge sort algorithm to return an array
             ordered in ascending order
          1) quick_sort(items) - uses the quick sort algorithm to return an array
             ordered in ascending order
